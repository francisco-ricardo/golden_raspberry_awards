# Makefile for FactoryDash Project
#
# This Makefile provides a streamlined interface for managing the FactoryDash project's
# development environment using Docker Compose. It defines common tasks for starting,
# stopping, and interacting with the application and its services.
#
# Usage:
#   To execute a target, run: `make <target>`
#   For example: `make up` or `make help`
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Docker
#   - Docker Compose
#   - egrep (for the 'help' target)
#
# Note:
#   This Makefile is designed for development purposes and utilizes the
#   'docker-compose-dev.yaml' configuration file.


.PHONY: up down run stop help


# Target: up - Starts the FactoryDash development environment using Docker Compose.
# Builds images if necessary and runs containers in detached mode.
#
# Usage: make up
up:
	docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up --build -d


# Target: down - Stops and removes all containers associated with the FactoryDash development environment. 
# This includes the main application, Celery worker, Celery beat, Redis, and Postgres containers.
# The `|| true` ensures that the command doesn't fail if a container doesn't exist.
#
# Usage: make down
down:
	docker rm -f gra.dev || true


# Target: run - Executes the 'supervisord' process within the 'factorydash.dev' container. 
# This is typically used to start and manage the application's processes within the container.
# It uses the supervisord configuration file located at 
# '/factorydash/.devcontainer/supervisord.dev.conf'.
#
# Usage: make run
run:
	docker exec -it gra.dev sh -c "cd /app/gra && ./mvnw quarkus:dev"


# Target: stop - Stops the 'supervisord' process within the 'factorydash.dev' container. 
# This effectively stops all processes managed by supervisord within the container.
#
# Usage: make stop
stop:
	docker exec -it gra.dev pkill -SIGINT -f "org.apache.maven.wrapper.MavenWrapperMain quarkus:dev"


# Target: help - Displays a list of available targets defined in this Makefile.
# It parses the Makefile and extracts lines that start with
# "# Target:" to provide a concise overview of available commands.
#
# Usage: make help
help:
	@egrep "^# Target:" [Mm]akefile
